# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository is a static site with all logic in plain HTML/CSS/JS:

- `index.html` — UI layout, lobby/game panels, and controls.
- `styles.css` — visual theme, card styling, responsive layout.
- `app.js` — game rules, state, rendering, and PeerJS multiplayer sync.
- `README.md` — quick-start and hosting notes.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

There is no build step. WebRTC requires a local web server:

- `npx serve` — serve the folder locally (Node.js).
- `php -S localhost:8000` — serve locally (PHP).
- `ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8000` — serve locally (Ruby).

Keep commands short and prefer one-line descriptions.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

This codebase is plain JS:

- 2-space indentation, `camelCase` for functions/vars.
- Use `PascalCase` for constructor-like helpers and `kebab-case` for CSS classes.
- Keep DOM updates centralized in `render()` and helper render functions.
- Avoid introducing build tooling unless requested.

## Testing Guidelines

No automated tests are configured. If adding tests, prefer lightweight JS tests in a `tests/` directory and document how to run them.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

There is no commit history yet, so no convention is established. Until then:

- Do not use Conventional Commits; write concise, descriptive summaries instead.
- Include `Co-authored-by: Codex <codex@openai.com>` in every commit message.
- PRs should include a clear description, linked issue (if any), and screenshots for UI changes.
- Keep changes small and focused; update documentation when behavior changes.

## Agent-Specific Notes

- Multiplayer uses PeerJS for signaling only; host keeps all game state in memory.
- The invite URL is generated by the host and includes `?game=` query param.
- If you change game rules or card visuals, update both `app.js` (logic) and `styles.css` (visuals).
